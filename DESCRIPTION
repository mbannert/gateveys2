Package: gateveys2
Title: Aggregate Survey Data
Description: This is the second version of the aggregate surveys
    package (gateveys). This new version relies on data.table and is much
    faster than the former version. It is originally meant to handle
    business tendency survey data, but is likely suitable for any kind
    of qualitative survey data. The package provides a toolbox
    to aggregate participant level data (micro data) to e.g.
    sector level time series. It also transforms the results into
    zoo time series objects.
