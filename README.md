# Aggregate Surveys 2 (gateveys2)

VERY INITIAL COMMIT OF VERSION 2. experimental.

This is the second version of the aggregate surveys
package (gateveys). This new version relies on data.table and is much
faster than the former version. It is originally meant to handle
business tendency survey data, but is likely suitable for any kind
of qualitative survey data. The package provides a toolbox
to aggregate participant level data (micro data) to e.g.
sector level time series. It also transforms the results into
zoo time series objects.
